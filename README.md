# Webcam-based Magic Mirror in Unity using OpenPose
This project demonstrates the use of the OpenPose Unity plugin to create a webcam-based "Magic Mirror" application in Unity. The application uses the webcam to capture video and the OpenPose plugin to detect keypoints on the human body. These keypoints are then used to map a skeleton onto the video, creating an interactive "augmented reality" experience.

# Getting Started
First, you will need to download and install Unity. You can find the latest version on the Unity website (https://unity.com/).

Next, you will need to download and import the OpenPose Unity plugin into your Unity project. You can find the plugin on OpenPose Unity Plugin https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_unity_plugin.

Once the plugin is imported, you can create a new scene and add a webcam texture to a quad.

Use the OpenPose plugin to detect keypoints on the human body, and use these keypoints to map a skeleton onto the video.

You can customize the skeleton and the look of your magic mirror as per your preference.

# Note
- This project is just an demonstration of how OpenPose Unity plugin can be used in a webcam-based application. You can use the same plugin in various other applications as well.
- OpenPose is a real-time multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) on single images.
